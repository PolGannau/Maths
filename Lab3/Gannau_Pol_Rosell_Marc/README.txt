The Lab #3 tasks are names as "Exercise#"
There are other files used as functions because we tried to implement them into the main fig code, but the code gave back errors
in some of its self created functions.

We have also found some errors but we just couldn't solve them.
All the three exercises work well, but if they are executed "opened" as a ".fig" file they won't work.
But if they are executed in the ".m" file with "F9" or the "Run" button all of them are working.

Thanks and apologies.
